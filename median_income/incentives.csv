4153,AL,Alternative Fuel Taxes,"The state road tax for vehicles that operate on propane (liquefied
petroleum gas or LPG) is paid through the purchase of an annual flat fee
sticker, and the amount is based on the vehicle\'s gross vehicle weight
rating. Each person owning and/or operating a vehicle that operates on
propane must obtain a decal annually from the Alabama LPG Board. The
decal must be affixed to the vehicle according to LPG Board
specification as proof that the issuance fee and decal fee have been
paid. Vehicle owners must apply for a decal within 10 days of converting
a vehicle to operate on propane, or a 20% penalty will be applied to the
decal fee. Out-of-state alternative fuel vehicle operators that purchase
propane within the state must pay the current Alabama motor fuel tax or
they may elect to purchase the annual flat fee decal. The propane dealer
or supplier must remit these funds to the LPG Board before the 20th of
the month following the date of sale.

Similarly, the Alabama Department of Revenue administers an excise tax
on compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as
vehicle fuel. Taxes are applied in the following amounts:

CNG:

-   \$0.08 per gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) until September 30,
    2023;

5616,OK,Alternative Fuel Vehicle (AFV) Tax and Fee,"Compressed natural gas (CNG) used in motor vehicles is subject to a
state motor fuel tax of \$0.13 per gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE).
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is also subject to a state motor fuel tax
rate of \$0.13 per diesel gallon equivalent (DGE).

In lieu of the motor fuel tax, some AFV owners are subject to a motor
vehicle fee. An annual flat fee applies to passenger automobiles, pickup
trucks, vans and heavy-duty vehicles using propane, natural gas,
methanol, or blends of 85% methanol and 15% gasoline (M85). Propane and
natural gas vehicles with a payload capacity of less than 2,000 pounds
(lbs.) are taxed at a rate of \$50 per vehicle per year. Methanol and
M85 vehicles with a payload capacity of less than 2,000 lbs. are taxed
at a rate of \$100 per vehicle per year. Propane, methanol, and M85
vehicles with a payload capacity greater than 2,000 lbs. are taxed at a
rate of \$150 per vehicle per year. If the owner acquires the vehicle or
converts it to run on the alternative fuel after July 1 of the tax year,
the flat fee is half of the above mentioned amount. AFVs must display a
decal that the Oklahoma Tax Commission issues on an annual basis.

automatically shut down the engine after five minutes of idling or
optionally meet a stringent nitrogen oxide idling emissions standard. A
heavy-duty diesel engine certified for optional idling emissions
standards must have a \""certified clean idle\"" label, issued by the
engine manufacturer, affixed permanently on the driver\'s side hood of
the truck. Similarly, off-road diesel engine APSs fitted with a proper,
verified level 3 diesel particulate filter must have a \""verified clean
APS\"" label, issued by the APS manufacturer, affixed permanently on the
driver\'s side hood of the truck.

Operators of trucks equipped with sleeper berths are required to shut

transportation fuels determined to be comparable with respect to
emissions. Propane is defined as a hydrocarbon mixture produced as a
by-product of natural gas processing and petroleum refining and
condensed into liquid form for sale or use as a motor fuel. CNG is
defined as pipeline-quality natural gas that is compressed and provided
for sale or use as a motor vehicle fuel. LNG is defined as
pipeline-quality natural gas treated to remove water, hydrogen sulfide,
carbon dioxide, and other components that will freeze and condense into
liquid form for sale or use as a motor vehicle fuel.

A bi-fuel system is defined as the power system for motor vehicles
powered by gasoline and either CNG or LNG. Bi-fuel systems are
considered clean fuel systems. Conversion is defined as repowering a
motor vehicle or special mobile equipment by replacing its original
gasoline or diesel powered engine with one capable of operating on clean
transportation fuel or retrofitting a motor vehicle or special mobile
equipment with parts that enable its original gasoline or diesel engine
to operate on clean transportation fuel.

inspection must occur at the time of the conversion; every three years
or 36,000 miles after the conversion, whichever comes first; and
following any collision in which the vehicle was traveling at five miles
per hour (mph) or greater. Vehicles originally designed and manufactured
to use CNG or LNG must also be inspected for safety following any
collision in which a vehicle was traveling at five mph or greater. Any
person who performs NGV conversions must certify to the vehicle owner
that the conversion does not affect any existing vehicle emissions or
diagnostic systems, except as necessary for the conversion. The Kentucky
Transportation Cabinet may establish regulations to qualify persons to
perform safety inspections; modify FMVSS for state use; and identify
converted vehicles and ensure compliance with applicable regulations.

projects for zero and near-zero emission trucks, buses, and off-road
vehicles and equipment. Eligible projects include, but are not limited
to, the following:

-   Technology development, demonstration, pre-commercial pilots, and
    early commercial implementation projects for zero and near-zero
    emission truck technology;
-   Zero and near-zero emission bus technology development,
    demonstration, pre-commercial pilots, and early commercial
    deployments, including pilots of multiple vehicles at one site or
    region;
-   Purchase incentives for commercially available zero and near-zero
    emission truck, bus, and off-road vehicle and equipment technologies
    and fueling infrastructure; and
-   Projects that support greater commercial motor vehicle and equipment
    freight efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reductions,
    including autonomous vehicles, grid integration technology, and
    charge management solutions.

Remanufactured and retrofitted vehicles meeting warranty and emissions
requirements may also qualify for funding. The Program is expected to
provide \$12 million to \$20 million in funding annually through
December 31, 2021. At least 20% of allocated funds must go towards early
commercial deployment of eligible vehicles and equipment. The California
Air Resources Board and the State Energy Resources Conservation and
Development Commission will develop and administer the Program.

-   By December 31, 2025, there must be 400 direct current (DC) fast
    EVSE and 1,000 Level 2 EVSE installed and available for public use
    at minimally 200 locations. 75 locations must include at least two
    DC fast installed along travel corridors, while 100 locations must
    include at least two DC fast in community locations. Additionally,
    15% of all multi-family residential properties must include EVSE
    infrastructure and 20% of all franchised overnight lodging must have
    EVSE available for guests.
-   By December 31, 2035, there will be 2 million registered light-duty
    PEVs in the state, and 100% of state-owned, non-emergency light-duty
    vehicles must be PEVs.
-   By December 31, 2040, 85% of all new light-duty vehicles sold in the
    state will be PEVs.

The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) must establish goals
for transportation electrification and infrastructure development for

availability and benefits of PEVs, state PEV goals, and the availability
of PEV and EVSE incentives.

NJDEP and NJBPU must prepare and submit a report to the governor and
